## Relationship to original Japanese Fork
If you want the latest and greatest in Japanese, check here: [github.com/ShikemokuMK/tyranoscript](http://github.com/ShikemokuMK/tyranoscript)  

This is the English fork. When new features are introduced, I will localize as I am able. If you want to bring a feature in or help out with translations, please let me know (@jsarcade or evan.burchard+tyranoscript@gmail.com). For now the translation status will live at the bottom of this readme.  

## Main Features

### Runs with HTML5 and JavaScript
Applications will run on iPhone, iPad, Android, etc.  
Also, using tools like PhoneGap, applications can be ported to be sold on the AppStore or Android marketplace.  

Of course, games will also run on desktop browsers.  
Using an expansion pack, you can also distribute games as Windows applications.

### KAG３/吉里吉里(kirikiri) Compatible
TyranoScript is made with KAG3/吉里吉里 compatability in mind.  
For that reason, windows games made with KAG3 can easily be ported to the web and smartphones!
### Smooth integration with JavaScript
TyranoScript allows for using JavaScript freely throughout.  
### Free for individuals or for businesses
Free to use as you wish, including commercially.  
Original software is open source (MIT License) and free to the public.
## How to Use
Check out the home page tutorial and tag reference.  
(English users may want to stick to opening doc.html and index.html in a browser for now)
### Tag Reference
http://tyrano.jp/home/tag  
(English users open doc.html in a browser for now)
### Usage and Tutorial
http://tyrano.jp/usage/tutorial  
(English users open index.html in a browser for now for the sample game)
### Developing locally
Chrome or Safari are recommended.  
When using Chrome, set the "-allow-file-access-from-files" property so that files in the local environment can be accessed.  
Alternatively, you can serve files from a server on the web or locally.
